**** Layout Notes *****

- Not enough IO.  Going to have to make considerations to eliminate some io

      - I need to run the MCU io to arduino oops.
      - put the leds in parallel.  Need to ensure that LED brightness will be close by running int this way


*** Changes:
    - Added diode to power the arduino header or master.


**** Things to check:
     - header for arduino,  does not match the footprint board.  Double check our header
     - Footprint for the diodes, 2 different footprints being used.
     - FPGA clk from mcu connected to one of the pushbuttons?
