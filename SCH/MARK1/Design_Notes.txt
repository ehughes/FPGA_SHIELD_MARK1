**** Design Notes *************************************************************

*** Questions that need resolved ***
    1) package to use, 100/144 tqfp.  Based on minimal cost difference between the two
    I would opt to go with the 144 pin version.
    2) spartan6 or spartan3a?  See the cost differenc in the dropbox excel mark1 parts file.
       $10.91 vs 7.02 between the 144 spartan3-50 and the lx4
    3)final functionality for mark1 use?  I like the idea of making usable in
    three different cases: independent dev board, slave arduino board, learning fpga/mcu board.
    See below for more details.
    4) upon deciding on final board functionality - decide on final peripherals for the different
    board sections: base,audio Pmod, learning, or some other combination.
    5) What are the thru holes on the arduino header?  Are they required?  They take up
    quite a bit of prime real estate. durrrr, arduino...



 *** Design Goals ***
    a) Dual use as an arduino shield or as a standalone development board.   The board
    would operate as an arduino shield (slave) or standalone mode in which it would
    run fully independently and be compatible with other standard development modele
    interfaces including arduino shields, PMODs, any others including microchip pictailplus
    PIMs, etc.
        a.1) Master mode would allow the mcu/fpga to operate as standalone (master)
        development board allowing attachment to as many external peripherals as possible.
        a.2) Slave mode would allow the FPGA/MCU to be an dependent slave device shield.
        The idea would allow the board to be similar other arduino shields.  Commincation
        from the arduino master board would take place through the spi/i2c pins on the shield interface pins.
        a.3) learning mode would allow for extension of a learning module that has peripherals used on fpga learning boards ( sseg dispaly, 8 dip sw, etc).
        A separate module could designed to mate with either 2 or 3 pmod headers to the base mark1 board.
    b) Similar to Embedd
    c) Drag and drop files for programming
    d) Non-brickable
    e) D2A <-> A2D
    f) possibly add peripherals to follow an existing text and examples?  such as: FPGA Prototyping By Verilog Examples: Xilinx Spartan-3 Version
    I have gone through most of the book, was awesome.


*** Base functionality for the base Mark1 board
    - flash for micro to hold fpga bitstream for gui reprogramming
    - flash for fpga to self load bitstream when used in independent mode
    - level shifters for the arduino header
    - jtag fpga header
    - lpc programming header
    - 4 push buttons (shared with fpga?  2 to micro 2 to fpga?)

*** Prototyping/learning addon functionality -  use 2 bottom or 3 side pmod header to
     extend prototyping learning capability (8 signals/ pmod header)
    - quad seven segment display   (8 signals)
    - 8 dip swith  (8 signals)
    - 8 led circle (8 signals)  (or put this on the base board?)

*** audio processing PMOD board
    - input/output processing of audio signals.  Will communicate through the pmod header to the lpc micro

   **** Thinking out loud ****
   1) Creating separate external modules for the audio processing/prototyping/learning modules
   would allow for a base FPGA/MCU board to could be used in multiple applications (Master, Arduino Slave, Prototype learning board).
   The auxillary boards could be fabricated using cheaper processes (2 layer board) while
   allowing more end user functionality for the FPGA/MCU board.
      1.1) Create a seperate standalone PMOD board for the audio processing
      that is currently on the board.  This would allow room for 2 extra PMODS to be
      attached to the mcu.  This would give maximum user options for development and final
      application of board.
      1.2 Create a separate extension board for the prototyping/learning
      parts currently at the top of the board (SSEG display, dip switch) anything else.
      The extension could be a double pmod or a standard .100 90 degree header.  a double pmod header
      would allow for yet more pmods to be used with the fpga/mcu board when it is not being used for
      prototyping.
