**** Mechanical Notes **********************************************************

*** PCB Fabrication ***
       - Will intially design to meet fabrication spec of advanced cicruits $66 4 layer special.
         This will allow for cheapest prototyping and end manufacturing costs
              - trace/widtch = 6/6mils , minimum thru = 15mil
              - min annular ring: vias=10mil , component holes=15mils

*** PMOD mechanical requirements ***
   - Need to find out if I can get the design standards from digilent on the mechanical
   characteristics of PMODS.
   - On my nexys3 board the 4 onboard pmods are spaced .400" hole to hole from each pmod


*** Arduino ***
    - Not sure what mechanical specs are required?
    - would love to get rid of the mounting holes  on the arduino header if possible
